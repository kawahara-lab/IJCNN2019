The Matlab implementation of our algorithm presented in the IJCNN'19 paper titled "Learning with Coherence Patterns in Multivariate Time-series Data via Dynamic Mode Decomposition".

We abbreviate Support Vector Machine as SVM, Dynamic Mode Decomposition as DMD, 
Principal Component Analisys as PCA, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding as tSNE, respectively.


## Data
Data used in the paper is UCI Daily and Sports Activities Data Set.

The data set contains 8 person's 19 activities.

For more details, see the original web page below.

After downloading the data, run make_data.m in the downloaded folder and put the outputs into ./data.

## Library
We use the well-known SVM library LIBSVM.

Download it from the web page below and replace ./libsvm-3.23 with the downloaded one.

## Description
svm_DMD.m, svm_SDMD.m and svm_PCA.m perform classification via SVM.

The input of SVM is the distance matrix of data.

The distance matrices in those files are computed by DMD modes, Supervised PCA + DMD modes, and PCA modes, respectively.

tSNE_DMD.m, tSNE_SDMD.m and tSNE_PCA.m perform visualization of the feature vectors above via tSNE.


## Example
Result of svm_SDMD.m is below.
